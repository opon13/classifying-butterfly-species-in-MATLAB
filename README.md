# classifying-butterfly-species-in-MATLAB
The purpose of this work is to build an architecture of a neural network that can learn to correctly recognize and classify the family to which a butterfly belongs. To do this, we will train the network using the dataset '*Butterfly &amp; Moths Image Classification 100 species*'.
